# ✨ How website response to the client
 **This is understand by simple analogy :**
- 🧑‍💻 (Client) → 🌐 (Browser) → 🖥️ (Server) → 🌐 (Browser) → 🧑‍💻 (Client)

<br>

1. 🧑‍💻 **Client** – the user making the request

2. 🌐 **Browser** – the interface used by the client to send/receive data

3. 🖥️ **Server** – the backend handling the request, processing logic, and sending data back

4. 🌐 **Browser** – displays the response

5. 🧑‍💻 **Client** – receives and views the final result

## 🧠 BACKEND
- The Backend is the server side of the website
- It stores and arrange data, and also makes sure everything on the client side works fine.
- It is a part of the website that you cannot see and interact with.
- It is a portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users.
