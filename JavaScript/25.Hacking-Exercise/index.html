    Create a hacking simulator which has green background and it shows these messages with random delay of 1 to 7 seconds:

    Initalizing hacking....
    reading your files...
    Password files detected...
    sending all passwords and personal files to server...
    cleaning up...

    the three dots must blink so that it looks like a  real terminal.
